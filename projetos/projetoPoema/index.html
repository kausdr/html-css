                            Yesterday, upon the stair,<br>
                            I met a man who wasn't there!<br>
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div id='dois'>
                    <p>
                        He wasn't there again today,<br>
                        Oh how I wish he'd go away!
                    </p>

                <div id='tres'>
                        <p>
                            When I came home last night at three<br>
                            The man was waiting there for me<br>
                            But when I looked around the hall,<br>
                            I couldn't see him there at all!
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div id='quatro'>
                    <p>
                        Go away, go away, don't you come back any more!<br>
                        Go away, go away, and please don't slam the door...<br>
                        Last night I saw upon the stair,<br>
                        A little man who wasn't there,<br>
                        He wasn't there again today<br>
                        Oh, how I wish he'd go away....
